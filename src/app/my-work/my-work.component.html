        <h2>Nokia</h2>
        <p>I spent 8-months at Nokia from January-August 2018. I was given the fantastic opportunity to be the lead developer on a new mobile product. 
          The mobile product was an event-based application and was built for both iOS and Android. I also contributed to a few internal Java Spring projects which 
          interacted with an Oracle database. <br/><br/>
          Nokia was my first experience working in an Agile Scrum envrionment.

        <h2>OHRI Mobile Developer</h2>
        <p>As part of my first-year COOP at the University of Ottawa, I worked at the Ottawa Hospital Research Insitute.
          There I worked on several apps developed for Android to help measure their patient's mobility. I returned to
          OHRI in the Fall of 2017 on a research scholarship to work on porting the applications to iOS.</p>

      <h2>Mobile App Solutions</h2>
      <p>My friend and I started a business during the summer of 2016. Our idea was to pitch to organizations and small businesses in our community to see if their service would benefit from a mobile app. We received a grant and scholarship from the Summer Company Program offered by the Government of Ontario to help with startup costs and provide funding for our schooling. We worked with a few clients that summer and greatly increased our technical and business skills.</p>
